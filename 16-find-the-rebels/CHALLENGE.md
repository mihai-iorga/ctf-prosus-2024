## TamaGodzilla PART 2 - Find the rebels

Grabbing your old computer gear, you bolt for the exit. The lights in your hallway flicker erratically, casting unsettling shadows that seem to move on their own. From the living room, the TV crackles to life with a distorted message: “Escape is futile. You are being tracked.”

You hear surveillance drones whiz past your roof, their sensors scanning every corner of your space. The alarm system triggers, its blaring siren echoing through the house.

Staying in one place is no longer safe. But where can you go?

The only place you can think of is the MAMA’s Group whereabouts, the rebel group you’ve encountered in your search of old computer gear.

Begin by analyzing the clues you’ve gathered. These hints will lead you

to their hideout.

Find the rebels, join forces, and prepare for the ultimate showdown against Tamagodzilla.
