# Challenge

## TamaGodzilla - Shutdown sequence

This is it – the final showdown. Your mission is clear: shut down the network’s central hub. Prepare to activate the shutdown sequence. This is the most difficult challenge you’ve faced, but you are ready. If you want to save your Tamagotchi, you need to shut the whole thing down.


As the sequence begins, the system resists, throwing every last obstacle in your path. But you are unstoppable. You can do this!

# Hints
- You start receiving a signal from your Tamagotchi, the signal is weak so it takes some time to decipher it. We managed to decipher the first one, it reads:

  `I’m stuck within a program that seems to operate on a 32-bit width without memory protection, I hope this information is useful to you…`
- The second message is deciphered, it reads:

  `I have discovered a “path” to make the program crash, this might allow you to breach the system!`
- The third message is confusing, it says that you can upload your own code but that you only have limited “reason” to do so.

  `Your Tamagotchi is in distress as there are bad characters looming around, who could that be? Try identifying the characters one by one.`
