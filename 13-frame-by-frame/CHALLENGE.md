## TamaGodzilla PART 2 - Frame by frame

To get the building code, you first need to figure out where the AI is operating from. That means tracking down its home base.

Lately, you’ve noticed something odd. The news has been showing more and more interviews with Dr. Saioto. But you know he’s not a real person—he’s an AI. So, how are there “real sightings” of him?

Curiosity takes over. You start digging through CCTV footage, hoping to catch a glimpse of this so-called “Dr. Saioto”. If this physical “Dr. Saioto” is out there, he must show up somewhere on the streets, right?

You comb through hours of grainy videos. You’re not sure what you’re looking for yet—just some sign, some trace that these interviews are more than digital illusions.

Frame by frame, you sift through crowds, cars, shadows. Time blurs. It’s exhausting, but you keep pushing forward.
