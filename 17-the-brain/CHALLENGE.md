## TamaGodzilla PART 2 - The BRAIN

You’re ready. You’ve secured the code to hack into the mainframe of Tamagodzilla, but the task is far from over. The code is divided into two parts: the brain and the heart.

Your first mission is to hack into the brain.

The brain represents the core of the Tamagodzilla’s logic and decision-making processes. By gaining control here, you can begin to disrupt the AI’s control.

Secure in the knowledge that the MAMA’s Group have your back, you prepare for this ultimate challenge.

As you delve deeper into the maze of the brain, you’ll need reprogram the Tamagotchi’s logic. This will be no easy task—the AI will defend this territory with everything it has. The brain is protected by multiple layers of security: advanced firewalls, intricate encryption, and deceptive decoys.

You initiate the hack, your fingers flying over the keyboard with precision. Deeper and deeper you delve, encountering decoy codes and false pathways.

The AI is relentless, but so are you. As you penetrate further, you begin to see the underlying structure of the AI’s manipulation.

Suddenly, the AI deploys its last line of defense: a complex maze of code designed to trap and mislead.
