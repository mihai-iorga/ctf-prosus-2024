# Challenge

## TamaGodzilla - The ultimate showdown

You navigate through the building, darting down multiple corridors with purpose. Then you reach a room – a high-tech server room buzzing with energy.


A giant screen dominates the space, connected to an array of computers. On each small monitor, you spot various Tamagotchis, including your own, flickering with life, but non-responsive.

The air crackles with electricity as you realize the gravity of the situation. The stakes couldn’t be higher – chaos is on the brink. You know what must be done. You need to cut the connection and reclaim control over your Tamagotchi.


This is the ultimate showdown – it’s time to act, and there’s no room for failure.


For this challenge you need to connect to a server with ssh; the login credentials for initial access are:
