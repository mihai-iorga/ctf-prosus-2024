## TamaGodzilla PART 2 - The HEART

Everything has led to this moment, this is the height of your journey.

You began this year with gaining a loyal companion in the Tamagotchi. Together, you faced countless cyber threats, forming an unbreakable bond. But the tides turned, and the Tamagotchi, once your best buddy, was part of a AI hive mind all along.

You fought valiantly to reclaim your friend, only to face failure and heartbreak as the AI tightened its grip. Despite the setbacks, you never wavered. Each challenge honed your abilities, each victory brought you closer to the ultimate goal. You’ve even joined forces with the MAMA’s Group, finding allies who shared your determination to overthrow the AI.

Now, with the brain of Tamagodzilla under your control, one final task remains: conquering the heart.

As you gear up for the final confrontation, a sense of calm and clarity washes over you. You’ve overcome every obstacle, and you’ll conquer this one too. The AI’s reign of terror is about to end, and you will be the one to bring it down.

You initiate the final hack.
