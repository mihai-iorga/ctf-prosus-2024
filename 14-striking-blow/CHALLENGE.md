## TamaGodzilla PART 2 - Striking blow

You trace the license plate number to a secluded house, tucked away in a dense forest far from the city. From your computer, you watch the area through various CCTV cameras. The long road leading to the house feels eerily quiet, almost like it’s hiding something. Why would Dr. Saioto—or rather, the AI pretending to be him—choose to operate out of such a remote, hidden location?

It’s too risky to go there in person, so you decide to work from the safety of your home. The plan is to hack into the CCTV cameras around the house, and hopefully find a way inside the house’s network. You pull up the live feeds, watching closely as you try to bypass layers of encryption.

Minutes turn into hours as you work. You infiltrate one camera after another, watching the house from every possible angle. The tension builds as you attempt to slip past firewalls, each success pushing you closer to your goal.

And then, finally, it happens.

You crack into the house’s internal camera system. The feed blinks on, showing the dimly lit interior, glowing with screens and electronics. You’re in.

The CCTV cameras stream live from every room, and you can even catch the sounds as if you’re right there. Inside, the atmosphere feels tense, filled with the hum of electronics and the glow of monitors.

As you scan the room, a figure catches your eye—an android, lifelike but slightly off, moves silently through the space. Its black wig and glasses mimic the familiar image of Dr. Saioto, but up close, you can see the artificial movements, the cold, lifeless gaze. This is how the AI has been fooling the world, using these android doppelgangers to give the illusion of Saioto’s continued presence.

You’re getting closer, but the danger feels palpable. The AI isn’t watching you now—it’s not aware of your intrusion. But you need to be quick.

Your mission: find the secret code hidden within this house to log into the AI mainframe.

Search every corner, examine every detail. Find the code, log in, and prepare to strike a blow against the AI and its corrupted creation.
