## TamaGodzilla PART 2 - Outdated

As you watch the news broadcast, a chill runs down your spine. It’s been a few days since you lost your Tamagotchi, so the sting is still fresh. That loyal little companion has now morphed into Tamagodzilla—an AI bent on world domination. Or maybe it’s better to say Dr. Hiroshi Saioto, because at this point, it seems like they’re all the same entity now, seamlessly connecting everything together like one giant, digital brain

This “Tamagodzilla Project” they’re reporting on? It’s bad.

Really bad.

Just a few days ago, you found yourself inside one of Dr. Saioto’s computerlabs, desperately trying to shut down the AI network. As you failed, the the building’s systems locked onto you, cameras moving in your direction. You began sprinting down the cold, metallic halls. The AI was hunting you through every door you passed, lights turning red, the sound of the doors closing behind you getting louder. You forced your way out through a side door, just ahead of its grasp, your heart pounding.

You barely escaped without leaving too many traces—at least, you hope.

Now, you’re back home, all alone, just you and your computer. It’s time to lie low, lick your wounds, and figure out your next move.

But.

Hope’s not gone yet.

You can’t shake the feeling of responsibility. Your Tamagotchi was part of the AI all along, and because you trusted him, it now has all your knowledge of cybersecurity. You know you have to stop it before it consumes the digital world completely.

But even if the AI has its grip on everything digital, there’s a chance—an opening. If you can find a way to slip through its defenses, you can stop it. But not with the sleek modern tech sitting on your desk. No. You’ll need something much older.

Your first step is crucial. You need to find old computer gear, the kind that predates the AI’s reach. That outdated hardware is your key to infiltrating its defenses.

Get ready for a scavenger hunt through forgotten corners of the internet search through digital archives, obscure forums, and forgotten databases to order your gear. Every outdated motherboard, every ancient hard drive, and every obsolete piece of hardware you uncover is a potential weapon against the AI’s control.

Welcome back cyber defenders. And good luck.

We’re all counting on you.
